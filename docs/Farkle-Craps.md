Farkle Craps
================

Equipment Needed
----------------

* A printout of the PDF game board
* Poker chips or monopoly money for placing tracing score and making betsbets on the table
    * See [Poker Chip Counts](Poker-Chip-Counts.md)
* Some way to differentiating bets on the table
    * If the betting objects (poker chips) are simply color coded per player, you're good to go
    * Scrabble tiles can be nice to set on top of bets (e.g. Ryan uses `R` tiles as markers)
* One marker for the "Max Bet" square


Objective
----------------

The objective is the same as regular Farkle (get 10000 points),
but but points are now money, and you're allowed to wager your money during play.

In general, bets are meant to be quick to place and resolve
so that the overall game does not slow down too much due to betting.


Setup
----------------

Set out the game board:

* [3-Kind-Corner-Turn.pdf](../boards/Board_3-Kind-Corner-Turn.pdf)
* [4-Kind-Fakle.pdf](../boards/Board_4-Kind-Fakle.pdf)
* [Bonus-Dice-Max-Bet.pdf](../boards/Board_Bonus-Dice-Max-Bet.pdf)
* [Secret-Attack.pdf](../boards/Board_Secret-Attack.pdf)
* [Triples.pdf](../boards/Board_Triples.pdf)

Assign players unique markers for betting


General Rules
----------------

Between each player turn, all players have the option to place wagers on the table

Wagers are placed in $100 increments (no $50 bets)

All lost wagers are returned to the bank (effectively points are deleted from the game)

Players may only wager a maximum of "Max Bet" (either $100 or $500) per turn

Payouts for successful bets are indicated by the red number
in the upper right corner of the boards

All bets apply on every player's first roll of their turn (not corner turns)

* One exception is the **Corner Turn** bet (see below)

* If you are playing with bonus dice,
  resolve all bets as if the extra dice were not present

* If you are playing with bonus dice,
  and the player happens to open their turn with 5 dice as a result,
  all payouts are active except **Farkle**

Payouts on bets are applied top of the original wager,
so a player that wins a bet on a $100 wagers with a 3x payout
will receive $300 and retain their original $100 bet

Players may pull any of their bets from the table between turns

Players may choose to leave or pull their wager from the table
immediately following any payout on the bet

* An example wher this matters is a player winning a "4 of a Kind" bet
  that is also part of a "Corner Turn" roll.
  The "4 of a Kind" bet is paid out, and the player can immediately pull
  their wager before it is cleared by the "Corner Turn" resolution.

Wagers on the table count as part of each player's total score

If playing [Fakle Attack](Farkle-Attack.md) rules at the same time,
any player turn that uses additional dice or is short a die is completely
ignored for all Farkle Craps rules


Max Bet
----------------

At the end of every player's turn, the indicator is placed on the Max Bet,
per this:

* 500: If the last player turned the corner on their turn
* 100: If the last player failed to turn the corner on their turn

This indicotor is the maximum amount of betting each player can add between turns.
If Max Bet is a 500, players may split this across multiple wagers.

The purpose of Max Bet is to limit how quickly bets (and game swings) can grow.


Bet Expirations
----------------

Every standard betting area has an expiration above it. These include:

* **On Next Open**:
  As soon as the next player finishes their first roll,
  all of these bets are wiped to the bank

* **On Next Player Turn**:
  As soon as the next player finishes their full turn (including corner turns),
  all of these bets are wiped to the bank

* **Before Next Corner Turn**:
  As soon as a player successfully turns the corner,
  all of these bets are wiped to the bank

    * If playing with bonus dice, corner turns are ignored during turns
      that use extra dice

Note that any successful bets that score in the same roll as the above expiration
is awarded before the bets are wiped


Specific Bets
----------------

* **Farkle**: The player rolls all six dice for zero points
  (on the first roll)
 
   * A 5-die role (due to Fakle Attack rules) does not count for this

* **Triples**: The player rolls three or more matching dice of the specified value
  (on the first roll)

* **3 of Kind**: The player rolls three or more matching dice
  (on the first roll)

* **4 of Kind**: The player rolls four or more matching dice
  (on the first roll)

* **Corner Turn**: The player successfully completes a corner turn before the end of their turn


Secret Attack
------------

The bets on this sheet are very different than the rest.

Each player may place at most 2 bets in this section during the entire game.

To place a bet, write on note card:

* Front (public): Your name and current total score (including wagers)
* Back (private): Name of your attack target and a wager of any amount

As usual, players may add/replace bets in this section between player turns.

* Any time a wager is modified, the player's current total core (front of card)
  **must** be updated

The bets are resolved any time a 6 die roll (ignoring bonus dice) matches (including corner turns)

* These bets are resolve after all other payouts

Resolving the Secret Attack bets:

* For each bet (note card):

    * Add the betting player's "current total score" (at the time of creating the bet)
      and the wager (back of card) together, to get a "required score"

    * If the betting player's actual current score is less than "required score",
      simply discard the bet

    * If the betting player's actual current score is equal to or greater
      than "required score", then the target player (back of card)
      lose the value of the wager (back of card) to the bank

    * Discard the bet
