Poker Chip Counts
================

You will need approximately $10000 per player, in $50 increments.

Here is a 4-color chip break down that works well per player:

* 4x $2,500
* 5x $500
* 5x $100
* 5x $50

... so for four players:

* 16x $2,500
* 20x $500
* 20x $100
* 20x $50

This allows for just enough for player to have change for the next tier of chips,
along with a few extra $50/$100 chips, which is useful for betting.

See [Farkle-Craps-Chip-Counts.ods](docs/Farkle-Craps-Chip-Counts.ods)
(OpenOffice spreadsheet) for some rough calculation of different chip breakdowns
vs number of players.
