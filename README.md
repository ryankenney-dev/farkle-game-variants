Farkle Game Variants
================

Overview
----------------

These are variants of standard Fakle (dice game).

Both variants can be played together.

Both are my (Ryan Kenney) orignal creations,
but I am sure similar games have been created before/since.


The Variants
----------------

[Farkle Attack](docs/Farkle-Attack.md): Played with 3 extra dice. Allows for bigger swings and the aability to affect each other.

[Farkle Craps](docs/Farkle-Craps.md): Allows betting during other players' turns.

* [Poker Chip Counts](docs/Poker-Chip-Counts.md)
